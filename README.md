# scj3-2 - claujson_pool
experimental parallel json parser, (using simdjson, memory pool, thread)

scanning - simd,

parsing - multi-thread(used in clauparser),

save - multi-thread
  
(C++14~, 64bit)

# Usage... with citylots.json

```c++
//claujson::init(0); // //
claujson::parser p;
claujson::writer w;
claujson::Document d;
bool ok;

auto x = p.parse(argv[1], d, 0); // filename, Value, thread_num...

claujson::_Value& j = d.Get();

if (!x.first) {
	std::cout << "fail\n";
	//claujson::clean(j);
	return 1;
}

//claujson::save("test12.txt", j);
w.write_parallel(d.GetAllocator(), "test34.json", j, 0);

int counter = 0;
ok = x.first;

double sum = 0;

static const auto& _geometry = claujson::_Value(d.GetAllocator(), "geometry"sv);
static const auto& _coordinates = claujson::_Value(d.GetAllocator(), "coordinates"sv);

if (true && ok) {
    for (int i = 0; i < 1; ++i) {
        if (j.is_structured()) {
            auto& features = j[1];
            claujson::Array* features_arr = features.as_array(); // as_array_ptr() ?
            if (!features_arr) {
                continue;
            }
            for (auto& feature : *features_arr) { // feature["geometry"sv] <- no utf-8 str chk?, at("geometry"sv) : check valid utf-8 str?
                auto& coordinate = feature[_geometry][_coordinates][0]; 
                claujson::Array* coordinate_arr = coordinate.as_array();
                if (!coordinate_arr) {
                    continue;
                }
                for (auto& coordinate_ : *coordinate_arr) {
                    claujson::Array* coordinate__arr = coordinate_.as_array();
                    if (!coordinate__arr) {
                        continue;
                    }
                    for (auto& x : *coordinate__arr) {
                        if (x.is_float()) {
                            sum += x.float_val();
                            counter++;
                        }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}

std::cout << sum << " ";
std::cout << counter << "  ";

//claujson::clean(j);
